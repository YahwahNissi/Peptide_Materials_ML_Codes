This repository contains the code and resources for our research presented in the paper "Discovery of Unconventional and Non-Intuitive Self-assembling Peptide Materials using Experiment-Driven Machine Learning."

Based on experimental data from approximately 268 pentapeptides, we developed machine learning models to predict the formation of β-sheet secondary structures given an amino acid sequence. To enhance accessibility and usability, we have also created a web application (https://ir-score-prediction-app-bx6mcydugk2weuxcleiyhl.streamlit.app/) that allows users to input pentapeptide sequences and receive predictions on whether they form β-sheet structures.
