### Peptides_Materials_ML_Codes
This repository contains the code and resources for our research presented in the paper "Discovery of Unconventional and Non-Intuitive Self-assembling Peptide Materials using Experiment-Driven Machine Learning."

Based on experimental data from ~268 pentapeptides, we developed a machine learning model to predict the formation of β-sheet secondary structures given an amino acid sequence. To facilitate broader access and usability, we have also developed a web application (https://ir-score-prediction-app-bx6mcydugk2weuxcleiyhl.streamlit.app/) that allows users to input pentapeptide sequences and receive predictions on whether they form β-sheet structures.
